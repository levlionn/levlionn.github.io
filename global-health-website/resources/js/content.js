        main_text: "<p>In class 6, we talked about communicable diseases hindering global health. Those disease involve  HIV, Malaria, Tuberculosis, LRI, and diarrhea. These are one of the major issues the world is experiencing and they could easily be prevented by immunization, proper infection control, and adequate nutrition. We also discussed that the problem for prevention of these diseases is that these happen among the populations that are most affected by climate change, poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment. In class 1, we had to watch Stephen Lewis' keynote speech in which he touched upon these issues and said that government plays a huge role on its people's health. He mentioned how Indian government is hiding its challenges with treating TB from the outside world, hence, ruining India's health even more because other countries could help like in the case with Africa</p><p>In class 1, we learned about Sustainable Development Goals which present 17 global health goals in progress to this day. All of these discuss diverse challenges mentioned in the course learning outcome. This gave me an overall understanding of what global issues there are and what is being done to get rid of them. As mentioned above, we also talked about Stephen Lewis and his opinion on the world's unhealthiness, he mentioned various issues hindering global health like poverty, inequality, bad economy, unemployment, bad housing, and dehydration stressing the point that instead of just focusing on poverty, we have to focus on achieving global health overall.</p> <p>In class 3, we discussed cancer still being one of the leading killers of the world even with improved prevention and diagnosis. We discussed how this issue is related to various risk factors such as poverty and unhealthy lifestyles which can be prevented.</p> ",

It perfectly relates to this learning outcome because in my perspective it shows social and economical challenges preventing us from reaching global health. Firstly, it represents poverty, an economical challenge that has been in place for ages which also leads to other issues like food insecurity and homelessness. Additionally, it represents a social issue: people in developed countries are not aware of how bad the situation is in the developing countries/regions. This is a challenge to global health because unawareness of poverty by the richer countries means they could help potentially help, they just do not understand the extend of the problem"

                text: "This is a video created by Nas Daily called Are We Wasting More Food Than We Eat? .  This video's title is pretty self-explanatory, it discusses that humanity is wasting enormous amounts of food while there are people suffering from hunger, one of the barriers to global health. This video also discusses the fact that the largest waste comes from grocery stores which throw out food not because it's expired but because it does not look presentable to the consumer. It relates to the learning outcome because it taught another challenge hindering global health: food waste.  "
