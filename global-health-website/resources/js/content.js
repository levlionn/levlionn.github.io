These are one of the major issues the world is experiencing and they could easily be prevented by immunization, proper infection control, and adequate nutrition. We also discussed that the problem for prevention of these diseases is that these happen among the populations that are most affected by climate change, poverty, food insecurity, and unemployment. In class 1, we had to watch Stephen Lewis' keynote speech in which he touched upon these issues and said that government plays a huge role on its people's health. He mentioned how Indian government is hiding its challenges with treating TB from the outside world, hence, ruining India's health even more because other countries could help like in the case with Africa. </p><p>In class 1, we learned about Sustainable Development Goals which present 17 global health goals in progress to this day. All of these discuss diverse challenges mentioned in the course learning outcome. This gave me an overall understanding of what global issues there are and what is being done to get rid of them. As mentioned above, we also talked about Stephen Lewis and his opinion on the world's unhealthiness, he mentioned various issues hindering global health like poverty, inequality, bad economy, unemployment, bad housing, and dehydration stressing the point that instead of just focusing on poverty, we have to focus on achieving global health overall.</p> <p>In class 3, we discussed cancer still being one of the leading killers of the world even with improved prevention and diagnosis. We discussed how this issue is related to various risk factors such as poverty and unhealthy lifestyles which can be prevented. </p> ",

It perfectly relates to this learning outcome because in my perspective it shows social and economical challenges preventing us from reaching global health. Firstly, it represents poverty, an economical challenge that has been in place for ages which also leads to other issues like food insecurity and homelessness. Additionally, it represents a social issue: people in developed countries are not aware of how bad the situation is in the developing countries/regions. This is a challenge to global health because unawareness of poverty by the richer countries means they could help, they just do not understand the extend of the problem."

This video also discusses the fact that the largest waste comes from grocery stores which throw out food not because it's expired but because it does not look presentable to the consumer. It relates to the learning outcome because it taught me another challenge hindering global health: food waste.    "

We discussed how these diseases can be transmitted from an agent to a host through a favourable environment either directly (pneumonia) or with the help of a vector (malaria). We analyzed diseases like Pneumonia, Diarrhoea, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. We talked about how each of them gets transmitted, their mortality/morbidity statistic, how to treat them, and most importantly how to prevent them.  Preventative measures discussed included vaccinations, nurses' involvement and proper education (e.g. refugee health understanding), vector control,  Self-Tests, low cost drugs, and proper infection control knowledge.</p> <p>In class 7, we talked about non-communicable diseases. We discussed the fact that these diseases, even though are not transmittable, are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. The diseases we discussed include Stroke, Diabetes, COPD, Asthma, and Cancer. We discussed the morbidity/mortality statistics related to these diseases worldwide and in Canada in specific. We have also analyzed the risk factors leading to NCDs like obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, unhealthy diet, and excessive alcohol use. We also learned that NCDs mostly happen in poorer populations as poverty plays a huge role in the risk factors described above. In addition, the importance of nurses was highlighted in class as well, as these diseases are highly influenced by Social Determinants of Health on which nursing profession is well-educated.  </p><p>In class 8, we discussed child/maternal/reproductive health. We discussed how it is interconnected with the SDGs, what global health goals exist to reach optimal health in these areas, and what interventions are still not in place. We discussed various new methods of contraception (male contraception), whether it is being educated well enough in different countries/religions, and what interventions there are to promote safe sex.  </p>",

In addition, we talked about the concept of Universal Health Coverage which is an upstream solution to many challenges since with that coverage everyone can access quality health care without any financial barriers.</p><p>In class 5, we talked about a 12-item screening tool which can help identify adolescents at risk of tobacco use. This was a good example of an upstream intervention because it can help predict future smokers and help in prevention (i.e. counseling services) . We also discussed upstream interventions to reduce emissions like using public transportation instead of private cars, taking into account fuel efficiency when buying a car, reducing energy spent at home, etc. Furthermore, we talked about a student-run Operation Green which helps reduce negative health care impact on environment by recycling, eWaste, medical equipment donations, etc. </p><p>In class 6, when we were talking about communicable diseases, we discussed interventions to prevent them: vaccines and proper infection control.

ICN also states that nurses need to become more in the policy arena (ICN, 2015). </p><p>In class 3, we talked about the Nursing Now campaign. This campaign targets nurses to be more acknowledged globally and to improve health worldwide. Because of that campaign nurses are recognized more as global healthcare  workers and are becoming leaders and builders of global health. This campaign explains that nurses make up the majority of the healthcare force, have thorough education on health issues (locally and globally) , and can implement their knowledge in advocating for patients/communities and in treating them. Learning about this campaign helped me gain a better understanding of how nurses can be involved globally and that policymakers support us in it. </p><p>In class 4, we talked about Partners in Health model and how the nursing profession is related to it. It turned out that nurses play a huge role in this model as we (as I mentioned above) make up the majority of the global health care force. That model acknowledges that the distribution of nurses throughout the globe is not equal but even knowing that fact this model still shows nurses as one of the most valuable professionals in achieving global health.

As we discussed it, we got to learn that this theory is necessary to be applied in global nursing as only by genuinely caring for the ones in need will we able to achieve global health. We were assigned to read an article written by Jean Watson called Social Justice and Human Caring: a Model of Caring Science as a Hopeful Paradigm for Moral Justice for Humanity which discusses nurses' involvement in social injustice. Watson (2008) states that issues like poverty, rising diseases, and social injustice exist and can be addressed by nurses following her theory and theories of early nursing leaders like Nightingale and Katharine Densford. According to Watson (2008), to reduce these issues we need 'to look into the face of the other, not as a different other, but as a reflection of each of us'.  She stresses a point that nurses are already doing it locally by simply listening to patients and being empathetic but that this has to also get global by using a model of caring science and applying on patient, community, and social levels (Watson, 2008). I think I've accomplished this course outcome because now I believe Watson's theory is applicable to global health since human caring is crucial for actions to be taken in achieving global health. Additionally, I gained an appreciation of the first nursing leaders like Florence Nightingale as they started the movements for better healthcare and have made a huge difference in the past motivating present nurses to do the same.</p>",

I plan on becoming a bedside nurse on a surgical unit and I believe it is important to use both upstream and downstream approaches there. A huge number of people develops noncommunicable diseases which can easily be prevented if we think upstream. It is important to think downstream to treat/contain the disease, but it is also important to think upstream and ask 'why did they get this disease in the first place?'. It may be poverty and inability to buy nutritious food. If, as a nurse, i will ask this question, I may be able to make a change towards global health.</p><p>In class 10, we discussed the opioid crisis in Canada.
